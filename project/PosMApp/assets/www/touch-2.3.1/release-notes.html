            Release Notes for Sencha Touch 2.3.0 Beta 1
        </h1>

        <p class="notes">
            Release Notes: Release Notes: July 16, 2013<br>
            Version Number: 2.3.0-b1
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>What's New</strong>
                <p><strong>Touch Grid</strong>. (Touch Bundle only) Grids are an excellent way of showing large amounts of tabular data on the client side. Grid makes it easy to fetch, sort and filter large amounts of data.<br><br>
                TouchGrid supports showing/hiding columns, resizing columns, editing rows of data, multiselection, grouped column headers, and more through the use of plugins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Touch AMF</strong>. (Touch Bundle only) Action Message Format (AMF) is a compact binary
                    format used by Adobe Flash/Flex to serialize ActionScript object graphs. AMF is typically used
                    to encode messages that are sent between an Adobe Flash client and a remote service.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Apache Cordova (PhoneGap)</strong>. Sencha Touch framework now supports the use of Apache
                Cordova APIs and packaging. Cordova APIs become active when you build your application usingg
                the new Sencha Cmd <strong>sencha ant cordova-*</strong> commands.
                </p>

                <p><strong>autoBlurInput Setting</strong>. The default setting for autoBlurInput on the Android Viewport is now false. This has been changed due to the inconsistent
                behavior of the blur workaround for different Android devices. The standard method of closing a keyboard on Android by hitting
                the hardware back button is now the default.</p>

                        <h2>SASS File Restructure</h2>
                        <p>
                            The file structure for SASS has changed to follow the same rules as the one in ExtJS 4.2.
                            This change has the SASS file layout mirroring the JavaScript file layout and allows future tooling enhancements
                            and dependency determination for CSS.

                    <li>Changed IE's Translatable to scrollPosition resulting in a ~200% performance increase for IE</li>
                    <li>Updated scrollPosition to a static large size (1 million px) instead of a constantly increasing one</li>

                    <li>Added ?showfps support directly to the AnimationQueue class. This option can be used to display true framerate on requestAnimationFrame capable devices.</li>
                    <li>Added '0' as a valid value for type in Ext.device.Push#register to disable push notifications</li>
                    <li>Added Native SQLite plugin</li>
                    <li>Added Android stock browser to the browser detection. This includes AndroidStock2 (includes honeycomb) and AndroidStock4. This allows newer browsers such as Opera and FireFox to run properly on older Android devices</li>
                    <li>Enabled CssPosition translation method. Use CssPosition (top/left) for individual List item positioning on AndroidStock2. Now uses much less DOM on this browser</li>

                        <h2>List Updates</h2>
                        <p>
                            We have added some configurations to List which help improve performance. The new useSimpleItems (name may change)
                            configuration uses a much lighter DOM structure to accommodate a basic List. In addition, having an infinite
                            list is now optional and is turned off by default. This is a change from Touch 2.1.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The default List options have been changed from Touch 2.1 to improve the performance of basic lists used commonly
                            in applications. Developers can now better tune these configs to their specific needs.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Platform Detection and Themes in app.json</h2>
                        <p>
                            Developers may want to maintain a platform specific UI. To help facilitate this, we
                            added a new option to the app.json configuration which allows you to whitelist specific files against the platforms of your choice. The
                            following is an example which allows different CSS files to be loaded for different platforms. The platform
                            detection is done in the microloader and we expect to continue to enhance this functionality in the future.

                            In addition, there is a new <code>theme</code> property which is used within the framework to identify which theme (CSS file)
                            is being currently used. Various themes in Touch 2.2 (Windows and BlackBerry) are applied to features such as MessageBox.

                        The Mozilla implementation is experimental and relies on FireFox 21's (nightly) flexible box
                        implementation. We are working with the Mozilla team on known layout issues. Most examples
                        run<strike>, but not Kitchen Sink</strike>. This should not be used for production applications.

                        <h2>IE10 Support!</h2>
                        <p>
                            This alpha release is our first with a non-webkit brower: IE10.  As more browsers support the CSS
                            features we need (primarily a solid <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/">Flexible Box
                            Layout</a>), we welcome the oppertunity to support them. IE10 also provides
                            <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/pointerevents/">Pointer Events</a> which has been integrated as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Supporting other browsers also means that any remaining specific webkit CSS and javascript will have to go. The
                            main impact will be with webkit-masks which we are moving to font-faces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the CSS can be quite different between platforms, we are doing some internal restructuring of our SASS
                            and providing our developers with some new options to help keep the CSS size manageable.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Platform Detection in app.json</h3>
                        <p>
                            Developers may want to maintain a platform specific UI. To help facilitate this, we are
                            adding in a new option to the app.json configuration which allows you to whitelist specific files against the platforms of your chosing. The
                            following is an example which allows different CSS files to be loaded for different platforms. The platform
                            detection is doin in the microloader and we expect to continue to enhance this functionality in the future.
                        </p>

                        </pre>
                        <h3>Theming Changes</h3>
                        <p>
                            The organization of themes has greatly improved in Sencha Touch 2.2. We have abstracted our default theme into a 'base' which consists of only the basic colors and layout of all components. The new 'default' theme and any new themes are then built on top of that <code>base</code>. This transition allowed us to review every line of SASS and remove any existing cruft that was no longer needed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We have also moved away from <code>-webkit-mask</code> icons and instead are using the <a href="http://pictos.cc/font/">Pictos Font</a>. The existing <code>pictos-iconmask</code> mixin has been deprecated and been replaced with the new <code>icon</code> mixin. With this change, you also no longer need to add <code>iconMask</code> as a config to your buttons/tabs.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Upgrading SASS</h4>

                        <p>
                            As we are still in alpha, the update process for the new SASS is manual.  This will be automated with forthcoming enhancements to the Command tooling.
                            Updating to the Sencha Touch 2.2 SASS should be straightforward. All variables will still work, however you will need to update your <code>@import</code> calls to require the new base theme:
                        </p>

                        <b>2.1:</b>
                            <pre>@import 'sencha-touch/default/all';</pre>

                        <b>2.2:</b>
                            <pre>@import 'sencha-touch/base';
                            @import 'sencha-touch/base/all';
                            @import 'sencha-touch/default';
                            @import 'sencha-touch/default/all';</pre>

                        <p>
                            Alternatively, you can just include the <code>base.css</code> file in <code>resources/css</code> into your <code>app.json</code> file, and only include the Sencha Touch default theme:
                        </p>

                        <b>app.json:</b>
                            <pre>"css": [
                                {
                                    "path": "../../resources/css/base.css",
                                    "update": "delta"
                                },
                                {
                                    "path": "resources/css/app.css",
                                    "update": "delta"
                                }
                            ]</pre>

                        <b>app.scss:</b>
                            <pre>
                                @import 'sencha-touch/default';
                                @import 'sencha-touch/default/all';
                            </pre>

                        <p>
                            The way component mixins are required has also changed slightly and dramatically speeds up the SASS compile time.
                            They are no longer included via mixin, but via <code>@import</code>:
                        </p>

                        <b>2.1:</b>
                            <pre>
                                @include sencha-panel;
                                @include sencha-buttons;
                                @include sencha-sheet;
                            </pre>

                        <b>2.2:</b>
                            <pre>
                                @import 'sencha-touch/default/panel';
                                @import 'sencha-touch/default/buttons';
                                @import 'sencha-touch/default/sheet';
                            </pre>

                        <p>
                            And finally, when using icons, you no longer need to include <code>iconMask</code> in your JS:
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <h3>Performance Changes</h3>
            <h4>Animation Queue</h4>
            <p>
                The first item to bring in from our <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/the-making-of-fastbook-an-html5-love-story">Fastbook</a> side
                project, we have added the AnimationQueue class and have begun integrating it into the framework. It will take some
                time to have this fully integrated.
            </p>
            <h4>List Updates</h4>
                <p>
                    We are continuously trying to improve the performance of the List in Sencha Touch.  We are planning on doing
                    this in multiple stages. In Touch 2.1 the infinite List rendered the minimum amount of items needed to fill the
                    visible area of the List. Then while scrolling it updated the content of List items according to where you where
                    in the List and moved every single one of those items individually to the correct location. In 2.2 alpha we
                    changed this slightly to a system where we only move the container the items are in and then when needed
                    translate 1 individual item from the top to the bottom (when scrolling down) or from the bottom to the top (when
                    scrolling up) of the list items within that container. This makes it so that in any given frame we only
                    translate a maximum of 2 items on the screen.
                </p>

            <li>Known Issues / Upcoming Changes
                <ul>
                    <li>The Back/Forward UI buttons still use webkit-masks and needs to be replaced.</li>
                    <li>Kitchensink uses only a standard and Windows theme. More examples will be updated.</li>
                    <li>
                        We also plan on reducing the amount of markup rendered for each List item,
                        even when using headers, disclosure icons and scrollDocked items. This will improve the performance further
                        since it will be easier for the browser to calculate the composite layer for one such item.</li>
                    <li>
                        Deferred image loading components which will make more use of the new AnimationQueue class and it's
                        idle task queue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The canvas font is blurry on IE10, we are investigating.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Android theme is incomplete.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>We are now preparing for the final GA release of Touch 2.1.  Until then we will be
            focusing on bug fixing, documentation, and performance tweaks.</p>
            <p>A DOM change was made to ListItems to improve performance by removing a level
            of box nesting. If you use a header with a custom height you will need to set
            that height in the sass For example:
            <p>
            <pre>
                .x-list-normal {
                  &.x-list-grouped .x-list-header-wrap .x-dock-horizontal {
                      padding-top: 26px;
                  }
                }
            </pre>
            <p>
            In addition if you were targeting ".x-list-item .x-dock-vertical", this will change to
            ".x-list-item .x-dock-horizontal".
            </p>
        </div>

        <ul>

                <ul>

            Release Notes: Release Notes: September 10, 2012<br>
            Version Number: 2.1.0-b3

            <p><strong>
                The new List component is included with this release.  This implementation replaces the old
                one for lists and is no longer bound one-to-one between a store and DOM elements. This means that
                the length of the list will no longer have a bearing on it's scrolling performance.  In addition,
                lists can use components if you specify them with an itemConfig and itemTpl will be converted
                to an itemConfig dynamically if you specify one.  Due to these changes, the DOM structure was altered
                for lists and you may need to change some css selectors to add appropriate styling for your lists.
                Typically you need to change the selector from '.x-list-item' to '.x-list-item > .x-dock-vertical > .x-dock-body'
                for any padding or margins you may have added. We have change the TouchTweets example from using a
                component based DataView to the new List very easily and should be a good example of using the
                new List component with dynamic large lists.
            </strong></p>
            <p><strong>
                We are releasing an update to Sencha Command and the Native Packager. This includes many bugfixes and
                enhancements including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>in-app purchases API for iOS</li>
                        <li>Contacts APIs for iOS and Android</li>
                        <li>Push notifications for iOS</li>
                        <li>openURL support</li>
                    </ul>
                The Native packages are also now plugin based and includes an API for developers to write their own
                plugins.
            </strong></p>
            <p><strong>
                We continue to add more to charting, and this release includes some of the labeling, grouped bar charts,
                axis titles, and more.  We want the next release for charting to be feature complete so expect the last chart types
                and missing functionality to be added soon.
            </strong></p>
            <p><strong>
                Once again, thank you for all the reported issues, we have fixed many bugs for this release and
                continue to work hard on them.  The major changes are now in place and we are continuing to work on
                performance enhancements and bug fixes until the release is ready.

                This is the initial beta for Touch 2.1 which is focused on the new charting
                package as well as bug fixes. The charting package has had a major rewrite and includes SVG support
                on devices which can support it.  Most devices perform faster with Canvas and will use that engine
                by default.  We will be adding more charting types and other missing functionality in charts
                throughout the beta cycle. The next release will be more focused on performance enhancements
                with updates to the layouts and events.

        <div style="margin: 10px">
            <p><b>Special Notes:</b></p>
            <p><b>If you are using a LocalStorage proxy, from now on your Model's <i>identifier</i> strategy must generate unique id's.
                We suggest you use the included UUID strategy by adding <i>identifier: 'uuid'</i> to your Model definition. Any existing
                Models you have saved to LocalStorage will need to have this added. A warning will be thrown for any Model configured
                with a LocalStorage proxy that doesn't have a unique id generating strategy.</b></p>
            <p>The <strong>change</strong> event in <i>Ext.field.Select</i> has been changed to return the new and old
                values and not records. This is to make it more consistent with all other form fields.</p>
            <p>The <strong>change</strong> event in <i>Ext.field.Slider</i> has been changed event now passes the Slider component</p>
            <p>Removed the default Ext.MessageBox requirement, added a proper error when Ext.Msg is used without Ext.MessageBox the requirement</p>
            <p>Refactored NavigationBar.  NavigationBar now extends TitleBar and has ellipsis support. Animations in NavigationView on Android are now supported</p>
            <p>Optimized Card Layout with extra absolute position wrapper, improves performance in complex applications and when docking items to the left/right</p>
            <p>Implemented a new default ui for the radio field</p>
            <p>Revamped Command, removed all binaries (now reside in SDK Tools installations entirely)</p>

            <p><b>Special Notes:</b></p>

            <p>Application dependency logic has been tweaked to allow more versatility in specifying dependencies from
                packages outside your application. As of this release any combination of local and external dependencies
                should be possible, but you'll need use Ext.Loader.setPath to specify where external dependencies can be
                found. See the <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/#!/api/Ext.app.Application">updated Application
                    class docs</a> for sample usage.</p>

            <p><b>Notes:</b></p>

            <p>Navigation View has been updated so the 'stack' is now based on the <b>items</b> config/collection. This
                means that if you define more than 1 item in a navigation view, the last item will <i>always</i> be the
                active item. The animation methods have also been removed from Navigaiton View. Instead, you should change
                the animation using the view.getLayout().setAnimation() setter instead, just like you would on a
                Ext.Container.</p>

            <p>The signature returned in the <b>callback</b> configuration of <b>Ext.util.JSONP#request</b> has changed.
                Previously it only returned the JSON object. It now returns the success value (Boolean) as the first
                argument and then the JSON object as the second argument. The class has also been deprecated</p>

            <p>The sencha-touch-debug.js shipped with Beta 2 now includes deprecated compatibility methods. Please remember
                that in order to use the smaller build without compatibility, you will need to fix any deprecation warnings
                you receive during development</p>

        Release Notes: Release Notes: January 23, 2012<br>
        Version Number: 2.0.0.pr4
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhancements/Changes
            <ul>
                <li>Added 7 new guides, including a <a href="docs/#!/guide/upgrade_1_to_2">1.x -> 2.x Migration Guide</a>
                </li>
                <li>Data refactored:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The data packed now makes full use of the config system and we recommend that configs be
                            used with the data package as with the rest of your applications.
                        </li>
                        <li>The performance of the data package has been signifigantly improved.</li>
                        <li>There are some event changes in the Data package and backwards compatibility for the old add,
                            update,
                            and remove events is not fully in place. The old events have severe performance implications and
                            we strongly recommend all developers change to the new addrecords, updaterecord, and
                            removerecords.
                            In addition we have added a new 'refresh event' to supplant the old 'datachanged event' which
                            was
                            fired under too many circumstances.
                        </li>
                        <li>Many issues with LocalStore/WebStore are resolved and this should now work properly.
                            Please note that assosciated local stores are not in place yet.
                        </li>
                        <li>Store paging is back in place and operational.</li>

                <li>MVC refactored:
                    <ul>
                        <li>All MVC classes now consolidated under the Ext.app.* namespace</li>
                        <li>All classes now use the 2.x class and config system</li>
                        <li>Routes can now be defined on Controllers</li>
                        <li>The Router from 1.x has been reinstated</li>
                        <li>Device Profiles are now able to load their own dependencies if activated</li>
                        <li>
                            Added 3 new guides - <a href="docs/#!/guide/apps_intro">Intro to apps</a>,
                            <a href="docs/#!/guide/controllers">Controllers</a> and <a href="docs/#!/guide/profiles">Device
                            Profiles</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>Kitchen Sink updated to use device profiles, history and deep linking support</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>ComponentView refactored:
                    <ul>
                        <li>ComponentView is now fully integrated into DataView and it turned on by using the useComponents:
                            true flag as a configuration option
                        </li>
                        <li>The event signatures for DataView have been changed to handle both Element based items and
                            Component based items. In addition the record is now passed on all the item events.
                        </li>

                </li>
                <li>Event signature cleanup: We are standardizing events to pass their scope as their first argument The
                    following events have been updated in this release:
